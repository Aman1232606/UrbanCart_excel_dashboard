## Key Business Insights
1. Sales exhibit clear seasonality, with certain months contributing disproportionately to overall revenue.
2. High sales volumes do not always translate into high profitability, particularly at the product category level.
3. Discounted orders increase revenue but negatively impact overall profit margins.
4. Regional performance varies significantly, with some regions generating strong sales but weaker profitability.
5. A small number of products contribute a large proportion of total sales, indicating opportunities for focused product strategies.
6. Faster delivery times are associated with higher order volumes, suggesting that operational efficiency influences customer purchasing behaviour.

## How to Use the Dashboard
Use the slicers on the right-hand side of the dashboard to filter results by year, region, category, customer segment, and shipping mode. All KPIs and charts update dynamically based on the selected filters.

## Next Steps
This analysis can be extended by replicating the same business logic and KPIs in SQL for deeper querying and in Power BI for advanced data visualisation and DAX-based analysis.
